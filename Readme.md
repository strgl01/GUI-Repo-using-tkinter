main.py has the GUI code and as name suggest it is main file
I have used file handling to implement login and register functionality.File name is db.json
db.py has code related to login and register functionality
API.py has code for api calls
By running main.py on your local you can get emotion,sentiment or named entity of the text you enter
When u run it you will get very user friendly and simple GUI 
Thanks\\
