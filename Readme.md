main.py has the GUI code and as name suggest it is main file.<br>
I have used file handling to implement login and register functionality.File name is db.json.<br>
db.py has code related to login and register functionality.<br>
API.py has code for api calls.<br>
By running main.py on your local you can get emotion,sentiment or named entity of the text you enter.<br>
When u run it you will get very user friendly and simple GUI.<br>
