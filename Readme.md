main.py has the GUI code and as name suggest it is main file\n.
I have used file handling to implement login and register functionality.File name is db.json\n.
db.py has code related to login and register functionality\n.
API.py has code for api calls\n.
By running main.py on your local you can get emotion,sentiment or named entity of the text you enter\n.
When u run it you will get very user friendly and simple GUI \n.
Thanks\\
